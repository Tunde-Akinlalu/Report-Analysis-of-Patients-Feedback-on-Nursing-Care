It is analysed monthly and reported using Rmarkdown. 
Other packages used include dplyr and ggplot2
This analysis is the first phase in measuring the quality of care in the hospital. 
The next phase will be the analysis of various variables like gender, payment capacity, level of education etc (as contained in the questionnaire) as they affect the perception of quality of care
